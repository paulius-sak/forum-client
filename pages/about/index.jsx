        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to Riddle, where every question is a challenge and every
          answer is a discovery. Our mission is to create a dynamic community
          where curious minds come together to explore, learn, and solve
          problems collaboratively.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Riddle was founded on the belief that every question has an answer,
          and sometimes, the journey to finding that answer is just as important
          as the solution itself. We started as a small group of enthusiasts who
          loved solving puzzles, sharing knowledge, and helping each other out.
          Today, we are a growing community of thinkers, learners, and
          problem-solvers from around the world.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is simple: to connect people through questions and
          answers. Whether you`re stuck on a tricky problem, looking for expert
          advice, or just eager to learn something new, Riddle is the place to
          be. We believe in the power of collective intelligence and the magic
          that happens when people come together to share their knowledge and
          insights.
